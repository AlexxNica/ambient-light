      <p>
        The functionality described in this specification was initially
        specified as part of the
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/sensor-api/Overview.html">
        Sensor API</a> but has been extracted in order to be more
        straightforward to implement, and in order to produce a specification
        that could be implemented on its own merits without interference with
        other features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes in this document since the previously published First Public Working Draft
        include the addition of the Light Level section with the LightLevelEvent interface,
        editorial cleanup, and an update to the references.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines events that provide information about the
        ambient light level, as measured by a device's light sensor.  A
        <a>LightLevelEvent</a> describes the light level as one of three simple
        categories - "dim", "normal", and "bright" - while a
        <a>DeviceLightEvent</a> provides a more granular answer by describing
        the light level in terms of lux units.

    </section>
    
    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs
        defined in this specification must implement them in a manner
        consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL
        specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that
        specification and terminology.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#eventhandler">
        EventHandler</a></code> interface represents a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#idl-callback-functions">callback function</a> used for <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handlers">event
      handlers</a> as defined in [[!HTML5]]. </p>

        The concepts <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">

        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">
        top-level browsing context</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handlers">
        event handlers</a></dfn> and
        <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handler-event-type">
        event handler event types</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Event constructor behavior is defined in
        <dfn><a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">
        constructing events</a></dfn> chapter in [[!DOM4]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The concepts <dfn>
        <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">

      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>current light level</dfn> is a value that represents the ambient
        light levels around the hosting device in lux units.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>current light level state</dfn> represents the ambient light level
        around the hosting device as a human-readable string.

      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy risks can arise when this specification is used in
        combination with other functionality or when used over time,
        specifically with the risk of correlation of data and user
        identification through fingerprinting. Web application developers
        using these JavaScript APIs should consider how this information might
        be correlated with other information and the privacy risks that might
        be created. The potential risks of collection  of such data over a
        longer period of time should also be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variations in implementation light level values as well as event firing
        rates offer the possibility of fingerprinting to identify users.
        Browser implementations may reduce the risk by only using the less
        precise <a>LightLevelState</a> of 'dim', 'normal', and 'bright' and limiting
        event rates available to web application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same JavaScript code using the API can be used simultaneously in
        different window contexts on the same device it may be possible for
        that code to correlate the user across those two contexts, creating
        unanticipated tracking mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser implementations should consider providing the user an
        indication of when the sensor is used and allowing the user to disable
        sensing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web application developers that use this specification should perform a
        privacy assessment of their application taking all aspects of their
        application into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The events defined in this specification are only fired in the
        <a>top-level browsing context</a> to avoid the privacy risk of
        sharing the information defined in this specification with contexts
        unfamiliar to the user. For example, a mobile device will only fire
        these events on the active tab, and not on the background tabs or
        within iframes.

      <h2>Device Light</h2>

        terms of lux units.
